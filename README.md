# The-ONE-simulator
The ONE is a simulation environment that is capable of  
* generating node movement using different movement models 
* routing messages between nodes with various DTN routing algorithms and sender and receiver types 
* visualizing both mobility and message passing in real time in its graphical user interface. 

ONE can import mobility data from real-world traces or other mobility generators. It can also produce a variety of reports from node movement to message passing and general statistics.
